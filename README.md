The class is called Roommate. The Roommate class takes in two arguments, the roommate’s name and the college the roommate is affiliated with. 
The Roommate class consists of five functions; the __init__ function, get_name function, get_collegename function, rating function, and finally, 
the freetime function.

A description of each of the class and data variables:
The class variable used in this class is univ_name. Univ_name is set to “University of California, Santa Cruz.” This program is for UCSC students 
to use to get to know information about their roommate so the class variable is set as the university name the roommate and the user is from. 
The private variables are located in the __init__function. There are two private variables in total, self.__name, and self.__collegename. 
The self.__name holds the roommate’s name while the self.__college name holds the college name the roommate is affiliated with.
